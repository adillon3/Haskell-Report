# Short program written in for the Programming Languages report
This program will take in 2 Roman Numerals as strings and add them together,
returning the answer in roman numerals.
The program will do this by reading in the 2 values as roman numerals,
converting them to integers and using Haskell's built in addition and data types
to perform the actual addition.  The program will then convert the integers
back into roman numerals to display back to the user
